# Getting better at Neovim

After spending a couple of days working in Neovim, I can start feeling more comfortable with the different modes and motions.

I still am not super good in Visual mode, but from what I have red it is a good thing, as eventually you want to almost stop using it completely.

I had initially started by adding plugins 1 by 1 in my Neovim config, to get more familiar with lua and understand Lazy better.

I also credit this to helping me get better and faster at editing text, as I did not have all the plugins installed at the beginning like LSP, auto completion etc..

This forced me to understand pretty quick how things work and also identify what features from a more traditional IDE like VSCode I was really missing.

I could have installed a starter pack like NvChad or Kickstart but in the end this worked out pretty well.

Config based on:
- [Typecraft dotfiles](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/dotfiles/tree/master/nvim/.config/nvim)
- [Nvim Starter Kit](https://github.com/bcampolo/nvim-starter-kit/tree/main)

TODO:
- post link to nvim config in GH
