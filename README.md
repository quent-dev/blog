# Intro

This blog will document my journey getting into software.

I already have spent time "learning coding" on various occasions over the last 3 years:

- The first time was during a career transition period: 

I did the classic taking a couple courses online learning HTML, CSS and JS and Python on the other hand.
Coded a couple of projects as homework, tried my hand with Python a bit but never coded anything fully functional, fully available online or that I could incorporate in my daily work/routine.

- Tried my hand again at the beginning of the year and the same thing happened.

- A second time this summer, this time leveraging ChatGPT first and eventually Cursor:
This time I managed to automate a couple things at work, create basic web apps that I can use at work etc...

But it still doesn't feel like I have a good grasp on it, and the constant composing/debugging with Cursor is not super fun and motivating to keep doing it. The reason why I want to learn this is because I like to learn things, not for AI to write what I ask it to - even if it is very impressive and powerful.

So I decided to go at it from a different angle since the same approach I have been using so far does not seem to be working.

I saw ThePrimeagen react to this [article](https://github.com/npmaile/blog/blob/main/posts/2.%20How%20to%20get%20into%20software.md) on how to get into software and really liked it for the following reasons:

- It seems to be a more fundamental approach
- It focuses on mastering text editing which is highly transferrable to other work tasks
- I recently installed Arch on my personal laptop to give it a second life as it was really slow on Windows 11
- It aligns with my interests: mastering Neovim and using Python to automate part of my work

So I will be following this guide as general structure and publish as I make progress on what I discover and learn.

## General principles

From reading various articles and my previous failed experiences, I have decided to use various principles:

 1. **Do the right thing**

For example, with Neovim it is temptinf to use arrows to move around in INSERT mode, but I will force myself to use the proper motion commands as intended to really learn it. In the past, I have prioritized having a working solution quick over properly using and mastering the tools.

2. **Do as much as possible from terminal and text editor**

In the same vein, it is tempting to do things more quickly in the browser or using the file explorer but I will force myslelf to do as much as possible from the terminal and Neovim to really get familiar with these tools.
